# 🚦 Smart Traffic Congestion & Accident Risk Analyzer

## 📌 Phase 1: Problem Definition

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to design and deploy a machine learning-based system that analyzes traffic patterns and predicts:

1. **Traffic Congestion Level**
   - Classifies congestion into:
     - Low
     - Medium
     - High

2. **Accident Risk Probability**
   - Predicts the probability (0–1) of an accident occurring under given conditions.

3. **High-Risk Zone Identification**
   - Detects geographical areas with increased accident likelihood.

4. **Infrastructure Insight Generation**
   - Provides data-driven recommendations such as:
     - Installation of traffic signals
     - Road expansion
     - Underpass construction
     - Speed regulation measures

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion and road accidents are major challenges in developing countries. Poor infrastructure planning, weather conditions, and peak-hour traffic significantly increase accident risk and travel delays.

This project aims to build a predictive analytics system that helps identify:

- When congestion peaks
- Where accidents are more likely to occur
- What environmental or structural factors increase traffic risk

---

## 📊 Business Questions

The system is designed to answer the following key questions:

### 1️⃣ Congestion Analysis
- At what hours of the day does congestion peak?
- How does congestion vary between weekdays and weekends?
- Which locations experience consistently high congestion?

### 2️⃣ Accident Risk Analysis
- What factors most strongly influence accident probability?
- Does weather significantly impact accident risk?
- Are accidents more likely during night-time or rush hours?
- Do high-speed zones contribute more to accidents?

### 3️⃣ Geospatial Risk Assessment
- Which geographic zones are high-risk accident areas?
- Are high-risk zones correlated with congestion levels?

### 4️⃣ Infrastructure Planning Insights
- Where should traffic signals be installed?
- Which areas may require road expansion or underpasses?
- What preventive measures can reduce accident probability?
